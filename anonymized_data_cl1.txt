Are you in the office today? I know you have appointments, that you're very very busy, and I know how very valuable your time is. During our appointments you always give me your full attention. You help me with anything and everything you possibly can in the allotted time we have. I definitely do not want to take time away from anyone else, BUT, these places go SO FAST!!! I was hoping to fill out the application completely then possibly stop by to see you so that you can enter the payment information first the $75 app fee. These houses go SO FAST and this one is SUPER NICE and they just REDUCED the rent, so its very time sensitive. Lmk when/if I can swing by or meet up with you. It will literally only be long enough for you type in the card info and thats it! We will definitely still have our appt tomorrow, unless you have something open today, then just stick me in that spot, please! Im just fearful that if we wait til tmrw to apply, it'll be gone like all the other beers I've liked then tried for, and ohhhh sorry, they JUST accepted an application, keep trying! I have a REALLY GOOD FEELING about this one. Please?? Please lets apply today!! Also, the realtor told me I needed to hurry and get my app in before someone else does. I have everything in place, all we need is to pray the $75 app fee. A money order to TexCen Realty will also work! Thank you SO MUCH in advance for your prompt attention to this matter!! Best". CM responded at 10:18am, I'm so glad you found a place that accepts rental assistance! I am sick out of the office today but if you send me the log in information to the application when youre done filling it out, I can log in from home and pay the fee. Does that work? Thank you, Rachel". CL responded at 10:23am, "F**********CCCCCCKKKKKK!!! IDK, HOPEFULLY it will allow me to save and go back in to pay. Fingers crossed. Dude, I am seriously praying on this one. I hope it works. I'm so sorry that youre sick. Do you think you will feel better tmrw or do OK reschedule our appt for later in the week? I'm open, lmk! Thanks! Feel better bro".

I'm worried that someone else is going to apply and I'm going to miss out on yet ANOTHER opportunity... I dont understand what happened. You said to complete the app and then email you and then you would go online and pay the app fee. But it's still sitting saying the same message, "to complete app.." instead of "app complete" I'm hoping it wont be too late once you get around to it. Ughhhhh this shits so damn depressing. Shit like this is what makes me want to curl up in a ball in my bed and just never come out. It gives me so much free floating anxiety that I stand there constantly swaying back and forth and I don't even realize I'm doing it. Then, I'll notice that Ive been chewing on the inside of my lip, but only after I've bitten so much of my cheek off inside my mouth that I taste the copper tinge of a mouthfull of blood and even then, Ill stay so anxious that I'll keep on chewing on it, knowing I'm ripping my cheek apart. It's subconsciously doing it without me knowing or else I do notice but the urge to bite it overpowers the common sense telling me to stop since its bleeding so much I have to keep spitting it out. I hate HATE hate hate this everything up in the air, nothing settled, not knowing what tomorrow will bring, and then eventually not even caring what tomorrow will bring. I hate this feeling... I thought I could count on you to do what you said you'd do. I bet you anything its going to be too late once you get around to paying it." CM logged into CLs account and paid CLs application fee.

I am attaching the promissory letter for this client, which notes that vendor registration must be completed before the City can make payments.

She was unsure if she could offer a 6-month lease but will find out. I discussed the rapid rehousing program, and she was very understanding. She is going to propose an exception to her upper management, but we do not know if/when they will approve it. With that in mind, do you want to continue searching for another property while we wait? I fear that most of the “income-based” places we encounter will have similar rules because much of it stems from “compliance” and tax credit rules/requirements. If you want to look into a few places I’ve worked with in the past (no guarantees, but maybe somewhere to start looking again), maybe see what you think. Are you available to meet next week? I could do Monday 3/21 at 10:30 a.m. Please let me know if that will work for you. Best, LCSW ESG Clinical Case Manager"

In the meantime, I have also attached a promissory note to this effect. On that note, has she been approved for an apartment at your property?
